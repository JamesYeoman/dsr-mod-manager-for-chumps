description = '''
This is a simple mod that allows you to see how many souls you will receive from consumable soul-giving items.

There are two variations of the mod: icons and text.
The icons edition of the mod will display the soul value at the top of the item's icon image.
The text edition of the mod will display the soul value in parentheses after the item's name (works for all of the game's supported languages).

Note: Boss soul amounts are only shown if you install the text version of the mod;
they will not have their values displayed on the icon images because many of the boss souls use the same icon but give different amounts of souls.
